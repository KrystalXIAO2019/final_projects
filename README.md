Background Information
From The World Development Report 2018 , “Education has long been critical to human welfare, but it is even more so in a time of rapid economic and social change.”

Project Proposal
Hypothesis
Tertiary Education Ratio increases every year from 1970 to 2010
Tertiary Education Ratio increases every year  with positive economic growth. (GDP per capita)
Negative correlation between Tertiary Education Ratio and Unemployment
Some correlation between Tertiary Education Ratio and Suicide Rate

Dataset: 
1. Tertiary Education Ratio:https://ourworldindata.org/tertiary-education
Percentage of population age 15+ with tertiary schooling. 
Time span 1970 – 2010
Data published by World Bank EdStats

2. GDP Per Country
Gross Domestic Product of each country in today’s US$ value
1960 to 2015
Total GDP, not GDP per capita
Merged with world population dataset to get GDP per capita

3.Youth not in employment, education or training (NEET):https://data.oecd.org/youthinac/youth-not-in-employment-education-or-training-neet.htm
Source: from Education at a Glance 2019


4.Share-deaths-suicide:
Source: Our World in Data

Step:
Unify all datasets
Pivot datasets so yearly data are presented in columns
GDP to GDP per capita
Eliminate country data with too little records

Conclusion:
Tertiary education ratio increases every year from 1970 to 2010
High positive correlation between economic growth and tertiary education ratio
Negative correlation between unemployment rate and tertiary education ratio
No correlation between suicide rate and tertiary education ratio
